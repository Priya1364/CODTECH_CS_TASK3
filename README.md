# CODTECH Cyber Security Internship – Task 3  
## Penetration Testing Toolkit (Python)

This project is developed as part of the **CODTECH Cyber Security Internship – Task 3**.

The objective of this task is to build a **Python-based Penetration Testing Toolkit** that performs basic security testing such as **port scanning** to identify open and closed ports on a target system.

---

## 📌 Task Objective
- Build a penetration testing toolkit using Python
- Perform basic security testing on a target system
- Identify open and closed ports
- Understand how attackers discover running services

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Socket Programming
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Windows Command Prompt / Linux Terminal

---

## ⚙️ Features Implemented
- Accepts target IP address or hostname
- Scans commonly used ports (FTP, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, etc.)
- Clearly displays OPEN and CLOSED ports
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Tool

1. Install **Python 3**
2. Open Command Prompt / Terminal
3. Navigate to the project folder:
cd CODTECH_TASK3
  

4. Run the program:
